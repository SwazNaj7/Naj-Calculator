# Naj - Simple HTML CSS JavaScript Calculator

This project is a straightforward HTML CSS JavaScript calculator that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus. The calculator also supports decimal inputs and has the ability to clear the current input or reset everything to start fresh.

## Features

- **Basic Arithmetic**: Perform addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), and division (`/`) operations.
- **Modulus Operation**: Calculate the remainder of the division of two numbers using the modulus (`%`) operation.
- **Decimal Support**: Add decimal points to numbers for operations involving floating-point calculations.
- **Clear and Delete**: Clear the entire current input with the "AC" button or delete the last digit entered with the "DEL" button.
- **Responsive Layout**: The calculator's display adjusts to the width of the button grid, making it responsive on different screen sizes.
- **Event Handling**: All buttons are wired up with event listeners to perform their respective operations on click.
